SAP Analytics Cloud is one simple cloud solution connecting your people, information, and ideas to enable fast and confident decision making. Machine learning technology and embedded artificial intelligence help you to discover deep insights, simplify access to critical information, and empower informed decision making for all.

For the Hackathon we prepared one sample from SAP Analytics Cloud, where you communicate with SAP Business One and SAP Business ByDesign. For that, you will receive readymade calculation views (in SAP Business One case), or you will be able to create new ones as you wish.
