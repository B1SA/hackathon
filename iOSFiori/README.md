The SDK offers a fully Swift-based API to accelerate enterprise app development in Apple’s Xcode IDE. The Foundation layer provides key enterprise services for security, connectivity, app services and more. The Fiori UI Kit provides a native, iOS HIG-compliant implementation of the Fiori Design Language, for iOS. The UI + Logic layer provides higher level reusable app components. The Mobile Services on SAP Cloud Platform integrate with the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS.
