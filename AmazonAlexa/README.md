Alexa is Amazonâ€™s cloud-based voice service. With Alexa, you can build natural voice experiences that offer customers a more intuitive way to interact with the technology they use every day. To do so, they can use mobile apps, several other devices and also the dedicated Amazon Echo, a speaker with built in alexa services.

## Overview
